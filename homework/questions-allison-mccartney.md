<p><b>Questions</b></p>
<p>How did you first start out as a journalist?</p>
<p>How did you learn data journalism? Were the intricacies of data journalism difficult for you to pick up?</p>
<p>What classes did you take at Stanford? What did you learn from them?</p>
<p>What did Dan Nguyen teach you, what was your favorite piece of advise from him as a data journalism specialist?</p>
<p>Lost & Found app - amazing! Sense of impact?</p>
<p>Role of SIR with government data? How much do they utilize/work with the same data bases?</p>

<p><b>Notes from talk:</b></p>
<p>The lost and found project</p>
<p>CBS: Journalism </p>
<p>PBS Newshour: after undergrad - rotated among the different desks (assistant editor for education), managed a website</p>
<p>Web development</p>
<p>Put all your code, even your terrible code, on Github</p>
<p>Templating language - one thing she knew how to do, Googled her way through things</p>
<p>“Write templates for this”, she would do research, pretend to do what she was doing, do a ton of research </p>
<p>Reveal CIR- The Lost & The Found: Federal data tracks thousands of unsolved missing persons cases and unidentified bodies. Use this tool to search for potential matches, Namus (missing person reports, unidentified body reports) - 2 different sites, don’t show photos until 3 clicks down</p>
<p>She added metadata in site so you can filter together or dynamically with keywords = clearer data set, application was part of the larger project, team won an award</p> 
<p>Learning to be in data journalism</p>
<p>The project must have stakes: be accountable to people that give you tasks</p>
<p>Go to meetups with other folks who do what you do, become their friend for real: community rather than professional workshop, collaborative environment</p>
<p>Share your code/stories/graphics with those people and get them to share with you</p> 
<p>Get comfortable in not knowing what you’re doing</p> 
<p>Do uncomfortable things over and over until they make sense</p> 
<p>When learning quickly, you will feel ashamed of code you wrote weeks/months ago</p>
<p>Who do you think this site was made for? (USA Spending)</p>
<p>Brown: advanced data search</p>
<p>Made for people who paid for the site, in congress, Benefits journalists too, show pieces for people who made them</p>
<p>Who uses this data? Target audience? Journalist is obvious, competitive businesses</p>
<p>Charging many thousands of dollars a year for access to it - people who were focused on business intelligence, people from federal government, selling it back to the government for tons of money</p>
<p>Open source and cheap applications - are her way of doing data journalism</p> 
<p>This interface does not do a good job at making data accessible</p> 
<p>Ton of data that is available, doesn’t mean it’s accessible, bridging gap between accessible and available 
<p>Open contractors’</p>
<p>How can this be accessible? Turning data points into pieces of information that sit in context with one another (into graphs, sentences that people can read)</p>
<p>Created a prototype of interface, search for companies, what are the most common services in the govt., questions that you could answer already but easier to access</p>
<p>Creating understandable context for data points</p>
<p>Still working with Reveal: investigative journalism</p> 
<p>apps.revealnews.ord/border-wall/</p>
<p>Only place where you can see a map of where the border wall is (dangerous data to the United States</p>
<p>Send reporters to the border, use satellite imagery of where the border wall is, why it is the way it is
<p>Combined data with satellite imagery</p> 
<p>Combining data application with on ground investigations - nobody else had done this, work with satellite imagery
<p>Advise projects, helping people make their stuff better</p>
<p>Creating tool for other journalists</p>
<p>Sample data set before expanding it to the whole thing, sample data set is hugely massive (mistake?), might as well done the whole thing
<p>DOD - most scrutiny, takes up largest part of proprietary budget</p>
<p>Lost & Found app
<p>Sense of impact? Did it make a difference? Strange case - missing person had a glass eye, distinct physical marker. Missing person picture - his eye is skewed, he’s wearing blue shirt, brown leather jacket - somebody matched it with unidentified person, pictures of clothing, fun to solve dead persons case</p> 
<p>7 years it was reported on, data part went on for 4 months</p>
<p>Site with pictures - hidden to ensure secrecy and gruesomeness</p>
<p>Overlayed a picture, with blur</p>
<p>Working with government data sets - why aren’t the government doing this already?</p>
<p>They don’t have to, don’t want to spend money on it</p>
<p>SIR: did they have things figured out?</p> 
<p>lostandfound.revealnews.org</p>
<p>To find anything on site, you need to make decisions, e.g. women, native american, went missing within this date → affects the information it gives back to you, playful experience (play with parameters, not stuck with certain info)</p>
<p>Job search as data journalist</p> 
<p>Some places know what your role should entail</p> 
<p>Employers - skill? Questions?</p> 
<p>Show that you can learn quickly, go to place to find knowledge, finding solution you need</p> 
<p>Nobody knows everything about data/info - talk to government people, find resources to figure out whatever you need to know</p> 
<p>Portfolio - know how to use more than 1 type of data, ability to learn quickly</p> 
<p>Hopeful that you have technical skills: data journalists know how to look at their data/what to pull out of the information, different ideas of what a story is, know that a story is more interesting than a sql query (not just about application but reporting around that)</p> 
<p>Reason attracted to data journalism?</p>
<p>Adding data to your skills puts your pay up, stay on, adds security, competing against people that are journalists and became developers, very rare that people go from computer science to data journalism</p> 
<p>Taqueria’s - strong opinions</p>
