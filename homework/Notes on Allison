<p><b><u>Notes on Allison's facetime</b></u></p>
<p>2009 Graduated in Oregon at Reed College, had done journalism internships</p>
<p>Became a waitress, met with as many people as possible, interested in documentary film</p>
<p>Internship at New England with investigative journalism</p>
<p>Realised documentary stuff wasn't my thing, followed a guy I liked --> California watch, hired her for 6 weeks, wrote story on disaster in area</p>
<p>Stayed at CIR after internship, so many opportunities through learning from other people</p>
<p>Been at buzzfeed for 2.5 years</p>
<p>Data journalism: combination of knocking on people's doors in the real world and coding on Python</p>
<p>What side of the work do you like better? I would miss the real lifetime news if it only consisted of coding</p>
<p>Difference between CIR and Buzzfeed: different pace, Buzzfeed is a lot bigger of an environment, more collaborative</p>
<p>DHow big is your team? In New York about 6 people, in the U.S there are 15 people (at Buzfeed)</p>
<p>Buzfeed - every reporter pitches differently, 'I like to write it up {a memo}', 10 questions i need to answer next, how it could fail</p>
