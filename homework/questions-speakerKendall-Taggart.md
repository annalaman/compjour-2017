<p><b>Questions for Kendall:</b></p>
<p>What did you study at Reed College? How did you first become involved in data? Many data journalists start as math or computer science majors and move to become data-driven journalists as they love writing, but what inspired you to become a journalist?</p>
<p>What would be your top tips for students like us who enjoy journalism and want to pursue it as a career? Personally, I haven't had much experience with data journalism, how can I extend my level of expertise in college to allow me to be prepared for the professional journalism work place?</p>
<p>What is working in New york like? What are the peope like there? What is it like reporting on such an upbeat, busy city? The demand for news must be very past pace, how many other journalists do you work with and how fast do you have to get news out and published?</p>
<p>What is the buzfeed workplace like? How many assignments do you get given a week? What applications do you mainly use?</p>

<h2>Notes on facetime</h2>
<img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios9-facetime-icon.png" alt="W3Schools.com" width="100" height="100">
<p>2009 Graduated in Oregon at Reed College, had done journalism internships</p>
<p>Became a waitress, met with as many people as possible, interested in documentary film</p>
<p>Internship at New England with investigative journalism</p>
<p>Realised documentary stuff wasn't my thing, followed a guy I liked, lead to California watch, hired her for 6 weeks, wrote story on disaster in area</p>
<p>Stayed at CIR after internship, so many opportunities through learning from other people</p>
<p>Been at buzzfeed for 2.5 years</p>
<p>Data journalism: combination of knocking on people's doors in the real world and coding on Python</p>
<p>What side of the work do you like better? I would miss the real lifetime news if it only consisted of coding</p>
<p>Difference between CIR and Buzzfeed: different pace, Buzzfeed is a lot bigger of an environment, more collaborative</p>
<p>DHow big is your team? In New York about 6 people, in the U.S there are 15 people, at Buzfeed</p>
<p>Buzfeed - every reporter pitches differently, she likes to write it up like a memo, 10 questions i need to answer next, how it could fail</p>
<p>CIR put me on the road for 12 days for certain stories, have to be prepared for anything, Buzfeed right now are willing to throw a lot of resources out for reporting</p>
<p>When she first started with investigative journalism, it was mainly because the job title sounded 'interesting'</p>
<p>The job fit, interesting at the workplace</p>
<p>Spreadsheet is the main core skill you need/will learn,  </p>
